## Style

I used the style based on a UDEMY Course.

## Functionality 

With Firebase Authentication (Google) each user can upload and keep track of their expenses which are stored in Firestore Database. 
And with the help of a filter, the user can change between different years. 
Finally a bar chart compares in real time the expenses made in different months of the year.

## Accessibility 

It can be used in all sizes. 

## Resources

React
Firebase
