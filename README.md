## Style

I used the style based on a UDEMY Course.

## Functionality 

With Firebase Authentication (Google) each user can upload and keep track of their expenses and incomes which are stored in Firestore Database.
Also it is possible to load different persons for each income, with different jobs to keep track of each worker.
And with the help of a filter, the user can change between different years and months.
